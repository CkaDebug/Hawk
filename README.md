# Hawk
Hawk Anticheat ver. BETA 1908.2

Hawk is a Spigot server anticheat plugin designed to detect and prevent abuse of the Minecraft protocol. Hawk does not require any dependencies, since it relies on Spigot, Netty, and NMS code. Hawk runs on Spigot/PaperSpigot 1.7_R4 and 1.8_R3 servers.

Unfortunately, because of CraftBukkit's DMCA takedown, this is not a Maven project. If you wish to compile this, you must have Spigot (or other derivatives) servers 1.7_R4 and 1.8_R3 as build dependencies.

If you wish to incorporate code from this project into your own project for distribution, please give me proper attribution. I don't care if you skid as long as you give credit where credit is due.
